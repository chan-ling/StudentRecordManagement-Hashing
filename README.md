# StudentRecordManagement-Hashing
Application Name: Student Record Management 

This Java console application demonstrates the use of a hash table to store and retrieve student records.  It uses a simple string hashing function for demonstration purposes; in a real-world application, a more robust hashing algorithm


Why I made this application :
This application serves as a practical illustration of hash table functionality. Hash tables are fundamental data structures used extensively in computer science for efficient data storage and retrieval.  Understanding their implementation and application is crucial for any programmer.  This simple example allows for hands-on experience with the core concepts without being overly complex.

Contribution:
It serves as a clear and concise example of how to implement a hash table and utilize a hashing function within a simple Java application. This can be beneficial to others learning about data structures and algorithms.  While the application itself is rudimentary (a simple student record manager), its value lies in its pedagogical purpose:
